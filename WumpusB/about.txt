		Welcome to the dangerous world of dragon hunting!

	You are about to enter a cave filled with all sorts of encounters,
	on a heroic quest to slay the dragon that torments these lands. 

	Many adventurers have tried, and none have succeeded. But from their 
	bravery, we have gathered intelligence about what looms inside these 
	dank caverns of despair...

	You may encounter the following obstacles:
    - Wyvern, an exceptionally territorial breed of dragon. 
	      Should you wander into a colony, you may find 
	      yourself further than you started...
    - The Abyss, a cavity of immeasurable depth. These caves are 
	      impossible to escape, but can be avoided with caution. 
	      Should you fall in, you will never return.
    - Dragon, the meanest of all foes. Kill it to win!
