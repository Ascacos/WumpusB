This first opening has seen a lot of traffic.
The walls sound... alive...
You notice bright red gemstones, etched into the rock.
Your footsteps echo into the gaping darkness.
This place looks welcoming! How suspicious...
You feel there is something odd about this cave.
You squeeze through tight gaps in the rocks.
Uphill? In a cave? How peculiar.
In the corner, you spot the decrepit remains of an ancient scholar.
The deep groaning of shifting rock around you, thrums in your chest.
Through the darkness, you can hear the trickle of water dripping down the slimy walls.
You stumble in the room and scrape your palms on the rough walls.
You stare into the void and hope it doesn't stare into you. A whisper emerges from the depth. It's your own voice.
A small hole in the rock above you reveals the dark night sky above - the northern star shines faintly.
Don't look! Close your mouth! Cover your ears! The cave will steal your hope!
The hot air in this cave singes your throat and makes you cough.
Your feet sink into the soft moss gathering in soft pillows; you become sleepy.
You run into the cave and have to grip onto the stone ledge as your feet give way and you almost fall into the abyss.
You walk slowly into the profound darkness and fear makes you scream but no sound comes out.
You walk in and fall into an open chest. The clinking of gold coins rings loud in your ear.
